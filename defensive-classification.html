# Motivation
- Professional basketball teams need a form of evaluation that accurately depicts playing styles.
<br>
<br>

- It is not wise to evaluate players in basketball purely on their box scores.
<br>
<br>

- Box scores are not descriptive enough to showcase different play styles across players.

# Offensive Player Classification

- Efforts in the past have largely been focused on offensive skillsets.
<br/>
<br/>

- Past classification research has used a variety of advanced statistics that help fill gaps that box scores cannot fill.
<br/>
<br/>


---

# Offensive Player Classification
### Metrics Used

1. Percent of assists on field goals made

2. Assists per possession

3. Turnovers per possesion

4. Defensive rebound rate

5. Offensive rebound rate

6. Zone shooting


---

# Offensive Player Classification

- Using traditional clustering methods like k-means, accurate descriptions of offensive play style can be made.

# Defensive Player Classification Attempts

- One of the major areas of research within the basketball analytic community has been quantifying defensive skill.
<br>
<br>

- Early classification of players used metrics that largely focused on offensive performance.
<br>
<br>

- Measuring defensive impact is much harder to do than measuring offensive impact.


---

# Defensive Player Classification Attempts

- One attempt at defensive player classification was using closest defender during time of shot.


- Although the idea of tracking defenders of shots is a good idea for defensive measurement, it can present bias.

---

# Defensive Player Classification Attempts

- The closest player at time of shot is not always the player that was actually guarding the player.

# Data

- Available data has exploded over the past four years with the introduction of SportVU cameras within arenas.

- SportVU cameras track the XY positions of all ten players on court, as well as the XYZ positions of the ball for 25 frames per second.

# Data

- Recently, the NBA has released advanced defensive metrics that allow researchers the ability to gain advanced insight into play styles on defense.

These metrics include:

1. Contested shots

2. Charges drawn

3. Deflections

4. Loose ball recovered

5. Screen assists

6. Opponent field goal percentage by zone

7. Speed on defense

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models

- In the defensive classification model, the number of defensive positions cannot be assumed.
<br>
<br>

- In clustering, when the number of clusters is not known, Gaussian Mixtures and the Expectation Maximization algorithm can be used to find the optimal number of clusters.

# Gaussian Mixture Models
### Chinese Restaurant Process

- A chinese restaurant has an infinite amount of tables for customers to be seated at.

# Gaussian Mixture Models
### Chinese Restaurant Process

Rules:
1. The first customer always sits at the first table.

2. The ***n + 1*** customer has two options:

  - Sit on the first unoccupied table with probability <img src="img/unoccupied-table.png" style="width: 400px; height: 75px"/>
  - Sit at an occupied table with probability <img src="img/occupied-table.png" style="width: 300px; height: 75px"/>

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models
### Chinese Restaurant Process

- ***a*** is the dispersion value of the restaurant population distribution over the entirety of the populated tables.

- ***a*** can be used as a probability distribution of a **mixture** of probability functions.

- Each probability distribution would represent each **table** in the restaurant.

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models

- A convex function can be created to represent the join probability functions in a mixture.

- These probability functions represent the potential defensive clusters that players can be in.

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models

- As points are assigned to clusters, weights associated with the distribution of the clusters are updated and factored into the convex function under a process called ***Expectation Maximization***.

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models

- The distribution weights will be updated untill convergence.
