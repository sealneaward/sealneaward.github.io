# Motivation
- Professional basketball teams need a form of evaluation that accurately depicts playing styles.
<br>
<br>

- It is not wise to evaluate players in basketball purely on their box scores.
<br>
<br>

- Box scores are not descriptive enough to showcase different play styles across players.

---

# Offensive Player Classification

- Efforts in the past have largely been focused on offensive skillsets.
<br/>
<br/>

- Past classification research has used a variety of advanced statistics that help fill gaps that box scores cannot fill.
<br/>
<br/>


---

# Offensive Player Classification
### Metrics Used

1. Percent of assists on field goals made

2. Assists per possession

3. Turnovers per possesion

4. Defensive rebound rate

5. Offensive rebound rate

6. Zone shooting


---

# Offensive Player Classification

- Using traditional clustering methods like k-means, accurate descriptions of offensive play style can be made.

<img src="img/offensive-cluster-2.png" style="width: 800px; height: 350px"/>

---

# Defensive Player Classification Attempts

- One of the major areas of research within the basketball analytic community has been quantifying defensive skill.
<br>
<br>

- Early classification of players used metrics that largely focused on offensive performance.
<br>
<br>

- Measuring defensive impact is much harder to do than measuring offensive impact.


---

# Defensive Player Classification Attempts

- One attempt at defensive player classification was using closest defender during time of shot to estimate defensive shooting percentage.


- Although the idea of tracking defenders of shots is a good idea for defensive measurement, it can present bias.

---

# Defensive Player Classification Attempts

- The closest player at time of shot is not always the player that was actually guarding the player.

# Data

- Available data has exploded over the past four years with the introduction of SportVU cameras within arenas.

- SportVU cameras track the XY positions of all ten players on court, as well as the XYZ positions of the ball for 25 frames per second.

---

# Data

- Recently, the NBA has released advanced defensive metrics that allow researchers the ability to gain advanced insight into play styles on defense.

These metrics include:

1. Contested shots

2. Deflections

3. Loose ball recovered

5. Opponent field goal percentage by zone
<br>
<br>
<br>

???
Along with these, traditional metrics will be used.

# Gaussian Mixture Models

- In the defensive classification model, the number of defensive positions cannot be assumed.
<br>
<br>

- In clustering, when the number of clusters is not known, Gaussian Mixtures and the Expectation Maximization algorithm can be used to find the optimal number of clusters.

# Gaussian Mixture Models
### Chinese Restaurant Process

- A chinese restaurant has an infinite amount of tables for customers to be seated at.

# Gaussian Mixture Models
### Chinese Restaurant Process

Rules:
1. The first customer always sits at the first table.

2. The ***n + 1*** customer has two options:

  - Sit on the first unoccupied table with probability <img src="img/unoccupied-table.png" style="width: 400px; height: 75px"/>
  - Sit at an occupied table with probability <img src="img/occupied-table.png" style="width: 300px; height: 75px"/>

# Gaussian Mixture Models
### Chinese Restaurant Process

- ***a*** is the dispersion value of the restaurant population distribution over the entirety of the populated tables.

- ***a*** can be used as a probability distribution of a **mixture** of probability functions.

- Each probability distribution would represent each **table** in the restaurant.

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models

- A convex function can be created to represent the join probability functions in a mixture.

- These probability functions represent the potential defensive clusters that players can be in.

<img src="img/mixture-probabilities.png" style="width: 700px; height: 350px"/>

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models

- As points are assigned to clusters, weights associated with the distribution of the clusters are updated and factored into the convex function under a process called ***Expectation Maximization***.

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models

- The distribution weights will be updated untill convergence.

# Defensive Classification

When applying the Gaussian Mixture Model, I decided to subset the data used into three sections that related to specific skillsets:
<br>
<br>

- Defense in the five shooting zones
<br>
<br>

- Ability to contest and block shots
<br>
<br>

- Repossesion metrics

---

# Defensive Classification
### Zone Defense TODO
Consists of only two clusters SO FAR

<img src="img/zone_cluster.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 325px"/>

---

# Defensive Classification
### Contesting Shots
Using five clusters these defensive play types become apparent:

- Skilled at contesting in the paint and getting blocks
<br>

- Average paint defender
<br>

- Exceeds at defending the three point line and getting deflections
<br>

- No effort defense
<br>

- Average defender

### Contesting Shots

# Defensive Classification
### Reposession Skills
Using four clusters these defensive play types become apparent:

- Blocking and defensive rebound machine
<br>

- Ball thief
<br>

- Below average at all repossesion skills
<br>

- Average defender

# Future Works
### Advanced Defensive Metrics

To gain a better insight into how well players guard during their possession, volumetric and disruption scores can be used.

- **Volumetric Score**: ability to alter the frequency of an opponent's shot against exptected frequency

- **Disruption Score**: ability to alter the shooting percentage of opponent's shot against expected percentage

---
# Future Works
### Advanced Defensive Metrics

- Using these two metrics, defensive shots charts can be created.

# Future Works
### Advanced Defensive Metrics

- These metrics allow researchers to quantify exactly how bad a defender is, and pinpoint their weak and strong areas.

<img src="img/kawhi-defense.png" style="width: 500px; height: 350px"/>

---
# Conclusion

- Previous player classifications ignored defensive skills in evaluations.
<br>
<br>

- Gaussian Mixture Models are useful at estimating number of clusters in mixed probability distributions.
<br>
<br>

- Unrelated defensive skills should be evaluated seperately to eliminate sparsity in cluster distributions.
<br>
<br>

- The defensive metrics collected over the playoffs allow a clear description to be made for defensive evaluations.
