                <h3>Résumé</h3>
              </a>

              I got into data science and prediction models after I took data management systems for the first time. Our final project was a simple web application that would utilize a MySQL server and insert real time traffic from a REST API using PHP. Although the initial task was very interesting, our group decided to go beyond the project requirements and looked into locating areas of Toronto that had a high probability of traffic occurring there. The algorithm we created was very simple, but that project really sparked my interest in the endless possibilities that came with data analysis. After that I started looking up techniques and technologies used in data science and enlisted in the Data Science specialization offered through Coursera to learn more about the field. The work I have done so far in the specialization was so much fun to do.



                <p>My name is Neil Seward and I'm currently entering my fourth and final year at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT). Over the years at UOIT and through outside development efforts, I have grown into a software developer with a range of skills and aptitudes. I have done some really interesting development in creating file systems, managing database systems, algorithm design and so on. Entering my last year, I really hope to learn as much as possible and really create something beautiful with my peers in our capstone project. Our team is currently seeking professors to team with for our project and exploring different topics. Ideally, I would like to work on a topic that involves data analysis.</p>

                <p>Outside of development, I enjoy going on different hip hop discussion forums. I actively participate and contribute to several fan communites that allow me to gain access and gather knowledge that I would have never gotten before. Skateboarding has been my main love since I was 12 years old. Over the years I started to get into skate film production and practised different techniques. I began filming my friends that I regularly skated, which eventually grew into filming the skate shops local team. It may not sound like a big deal to many people, but as a kid, I looked up to these skaters as a kid and religiously watched their videos. Getting a chance to film these people and participate in the local skateboard community was truly a dream come true for me. Today, I still skate as much as I can and I still try to involve myself in the local skate scenes as much as I can. If you would like to go see askate video premiere in whatever city I'm currently in, chances are I will go with you.</p>
