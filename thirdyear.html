                    <p>Third year was definitely very tough initially going in. The topics covered were very foreign at the time and, often for the most difficult courses, I was lectured by uninterested profs that had poor teaching methods. Operating systems was particularly hard in that the first half of the course was taught in C. Learning child process creation with a language never really used in your program that has weak debugging methods isn't always the most fun. Languages and Compilers was definitely the hardest, but it was the most rewarding. At the beginning of the class, I had no clue about anything that went on behind compilers and how basic text was converted into language readable objects and then ultimately to machine code. Ultimately at the end, I was able to make a Java based, Pascal arithmetic like compiler that evaluated simple addition, mutliplication, sin comutations along with other variations. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Artificial Intelligence</h2>

                    <p>I loved this course. The professor who taught this course was actually very excited to teach us about the different advanced algorithms used in the field such as A*, Breadth, Best First, and Depth First.</p>

                    <p>What really intrigued me were the last few chapters taught in this course on machine learning. The professor introduced classification trees and clustering algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbour. Those were some of the most interesting lectures that I've been to so far at school.</p>

                    <h3>Mancala</h3>
                    <a href="https://github.com/sealneaward/Mancala" >Repository</a>
                    <br/>
                    <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-play-MANCALA/">Read the rules of Mancala</a>
                    <p>This assignment didn't require the use of any method or algorithms taught in the class. I regret not putting the time into this project. I developed a solution around the techniques I learned playing an AI players on Mancala and now looking back, it would not have been hard to make a classification model from all the possible outcomes from the game logic.</p>
                    
                   <h2 class="section-heading">Database Management</h2>

                    <p>This course introduced the fundamentals of creating a database, making views, making stored procedures, and database design.</p>

                    <h3>LiveTraffic</h3>
                    <a href="https://github.com/sealneaward/LiveTraffic">Repository</a>
                    <p>Our group designed a really cool live traffic and incident display using two overlapping API for the display and incident data. Google Maps API provided an easy platform to grid the different traffic incidents in the Greater Toronto Area received from the HERE Maps API.</p>
                    <p>We designed our backend with PHP because it looked more easily learned than Node.js at the moment. Our entire group first experienced server side programming and getting JSON responses from a web service.</p>
                    <p>The main goal of the project was to fill the database with data gotten from an API and display that information in the form of views. Another requirement was to provide some sort of API service to get JSON responses from the database for outside use.</p>
                    <p>Our group decided to go beyond the initial requirements and thought it would be cool to show exact areas that have had a large amount of traffic incidents in the past. We implemented this idea by using a simple geo range query to find incidents that have a certain threshold of incidents within a boxed area around them. Because we only got data on incidents over a few days, there was not a noticible amount of correlation in any areas in Toronto.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Operating Systems</h2>

                    <p>This course introduced the fundamentals of creating a shell, process management, and creating a functional unix file system. The majority of the course was taught using ANTLR.</p>

                    <h3>FileSystemJava</h3>
                    <a href="https://github.com/sealneaward/FileSystemJava">Repository</a>
                    <p>This project was very interesting and helped me understand the complexity behind file management and the different processes that go on when a file is read from disk and when it is converted back to the disk.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Languages and Compilers</h2>

                    <p>This course introduced the fundamentals of creating a shell, process management, and creating a functional unix file system.</p>

                    <h3>LanguagesAndCompilers</h3>
                    <a href="https://github.com/sealneaward/LanguagesAndCompilers">Repository</a>
                    <p>These assignments were necessary for me to understand the different tasks done in compilers and what is done by a compiler to convert code to machine code.</p>
                    <p>I was very interesting to learn how to create a compiler and the different parts that are inside of one. I was very proud to make a small pascal like calculation language with java dependencies. The work and the logic was very hard to interpret, but I accomplished something great in a field I will most likely never get to explore much.</p>
