# Defining Google's Problem
- Google needed a new method to work with all of their indexed data.

---

# Defining Google's Problem
- The new searching algorithm need to work across a distributed set of thousands of computers
- These networked computers were considered to be mid-low tier in processing power.

---

# Defining Google's Problem
- The algorithm needed to be relatively simple to implement and understand, but still incorporate for fault tolerance, network bandwith, and other complex issues with data processing

---

# The MapReduce Model
- The MapReduce algorithm takes in a set of key/value pairs as input and produces a different set of key/value pairs as output.
